This repository should reside inside ~/.vim

Make sure to symlink the vimrc and gvimrc files to your home directory
by running make. This is unnecessary if you are running vim 7.4 as the
files are in the proper location.

It is recommended to create your own vim configuration rather than using
someone else's.

vimundo, vimswp, and backup are empty directories. These directories will
fill up with undo history files, swp files and backup files.
