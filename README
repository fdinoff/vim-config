This repository should reside inside ~/.vim

Make sure to symlink the vimrc and gvimrc files to your home directory
by running make. This is unnecessary if you are running vim 7.4 as the
files are in the proper location.

or if you want to continue having your own vimrc file add
source $HOME/.vim/vimrc
to the end of .vimrc
and add
source $HOME/.vim/gvimrc
to the end of .gvimrc

vimundo, vimswp, and backup are empty directories. These directories will
fill up with undo history files, swp files and backup files.
